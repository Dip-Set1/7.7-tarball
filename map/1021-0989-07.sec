Upon reaching adulthood, the young elf gets his first name, divined by the elders who know him in dreams. It is merely a single name, a description of the elf in the elven tongue.  Usually elves love to add a translation of their name which is often mistaken for a second name by other races. Since the elven language is far more complicated and has thousands of nuances, often elves with the same 'second name' have a different first name, confusing the other races even more. "}}

Hunted by countless enemies and almost everytime outnumbered when it came to fights with 'neighbours' they retreated into the deepest woods where the greater number of their foes was evened out. There they created encampments they visited now and then. They had contact with many creatures and cultures. They adopted ideas and inventions that suited their nomadic lifestyle and begun even a very cautious trade with other races to aquire things they were not able to build on their own. As the attention of the other races turned more and more away from the elves and wars broke out between them, some of the elves begun to live at their up to then only part time ecampment on a permanent base. Adopting what they had seen from other races and things they vaguely remembered from their own past some trading posts were established in this way. Usually only one to three families lived there. After the reunification with the Cenath the majority of them could be convinced to give a permanent settlement a try and the biggest tradingpost became the settlement Ab'Dendriel. Some families refused to join their brethren and continued to wander the world, only visiting the city now and then, each vistit convincing them more that they have only little in common with the  Deraisim anymore.

But this rage had cost more than one life and some of the most promising warriors died young on the battlefields. Heavy casualties caused their numbers to decrease dramatically. The minotaurs withdrew from the wars, but in a world gone mad, skirmishes with other races were part of their daily routine. The demise of the whole race continued. As the minotaur race became nearly extinct in the fights, they found refuge in caves, adopting a lifestyle much like their ancient enemies the dwarfs. \n\n", 2816 String="The only minotaurs reaching old age in these times of war were those who were born with physical disabilities or who were crippled but not killed in battle. This class of minotaurs was the only one who could live long enough to learn skills not directly connected to war. Since they were almost always the only ones who could gather enough experience and wisdom to create new ideas and concepts, the younger warriors begun to look at them as parents and advisors. Slowly these elders were able to change the war culture of the minotaurs. One charismatic minotaur in particular, Akkor, who was born blind, became the founder of the new minotaurian philosophy. He shunned the rage as a curse of the god Blog.  Consequently, the minotaurian religion, which due to the extremity of martyrdom and rage never had a real chance to develop, turned away from the raging one. Slowly new concepts were adopted and great efforts were undertaken to hold the rage at bay. Meditation and self-control became the foremost duties of any warrior. The minotaurian ideal turned towards role models who were in control of body and mind. Since fiery rage was in minotaurian nature, young minotaurs were trained from early on to control themselves. It was through meditation that the minotaurs developed art and soon philosophy. Complicated ceremonies for usually simple things of daily life were developed to focus the mind, to be aware of each second of life.

A minotaurian warrior is skilled as an artist, often found conentrated drawing, reciting or creating poems and wielding a weapon with awarenes and cold hearted skill. The warriors of the uppermost class are usually so well educated they control some amount of magic, often used to augment their own strength and defense. They are the heroes and role models of the lower class. The minotaurs still have a warrior culture, but the understanding of a true warrior has changed dramatically. \n\nMinotaur cheese is a specialty, often envied by decadent human nobles. \n"}}

The only gods some of them worship is Crunor, whom they call the \"Treefather\" and see him as bringer of life. Some of the elves prefer to pray to the raw elemental powers of earth and air. Mostly in the Kuridai caste the earth cult is more prominent than Crunor, and it is said that their complicated 'prayers' are more like summonings or invocations. It is believed by elvenkind that in their history seven elven lords acquired the status of celestial paladins and therefore are godlike beings. Worshipping them is a very personal matter though. It is certain that different high lords are more prominent in different castes but prayers and interpretation of the high lords is only shared on family level at best, usually each elf finds his own approach to some of the high lords, completely ignoring the other ones. \n\nMortiur - the ravager, prominent for some sects. The avenger, merciless against friend, foe and himself\n\nNera - the lady of spring (flowers, growth) completely replacing Crunor for some elves. \n\nDseyvar - the sworddancer, responsible for the grace of the warrior, elven warriors have to be graceful not chivalrous. \n\nPriyla - the daughter of the stars, mystery and magic \n\nKrynierr - the silver tongue, poetry, love and music\n\nAzmoda - the vieled one, mysterious figure. Mistress of schemes, cunning and deception.\n \nEvicor - the wanderer. Master of the hunt, the explorer\n"}}
