Worse, the plank was pulled back into the wall, and there was no way out. If it hadn't been for our good Alil who had stayed out of that cursed chamber in a rare moment of clear-sightedness, we would all have ended up as snake food. Just how he managed to find that hidden lever on the statue is still beyond me."}}

We were shocked by the sheer impertinence of his speech! The fool! How confused he looked when he realised our disapproving silence. I am convinced he had spoken to some of those filthy heretics before he went to see his majesty. I know there are some although none of them would dare to make his blasphemous opinions known in the public. How could the mighty pharaoh not ignore this ambitious fool and his futile plans. How haughtily he walked around in our beautiful Ankrahmun, mocking our true religion with his silly questions. Of course, he got nowhere and he seemed to give up in the end. But did the wisdom offered to him enlighten his blind soul? I think not. So full of himself was he, so firm in his heretic opinions and yet such a slave to his flesh - how could he understand that which is true and holy? People like him are both a curse and a blessing to us, the children of enlightenment. They may insult and provoke us with their ignorance, yet it is when we meet fools like him that we realise the full extent of the glorious state of enlightenment we live in. Far from ascension though we are, we have been granted the opportunity to achieve what will be forever denied to people like him - divinity!"}}

Thahon could not bring forth convincing proof of her guilt and was sentenced to ten blows on his bare feet. The crafter Ziril claimed that the beggar Aukohl stole a cake from his open window. Although no proof was found there was a general sense of agreement that no proof was necessary since everybody was convinced of the beggar's guilt. In a rare display of mercy the judge sentenced him to a mere three years of work in the salt mines. The widow Zehmahil claimed that the travelling bard Todd Ballory had promised here mariage in\nexchange for certain services that have not been further elaborated on in the court's documents. The foreigner was found guilty without trial and sentenced to three years of work in the salt mines. The footsoldier Kamahl claimed his father Indril was guilty of witchcraft. Several obscure texts were found beneath the accused person's bed. Indril was banished from the city and his property was equally divided between the pharaoh and his heirs. The foreigner Todd Ballory was pronounced guilty of killing the overseer Barnak, a father of sixteen children and a respectable member of the local whipcrackers' association. The aforementioned convict was sentenced to a rather spectacular final appearance in the local arena.", 2821 String="After thorough examination the Rathal I Pyramid was officially declared to be free of occult phenomena. The success of the ritual of purification performed by the responsible priests surpassed everybody's expectations, and the rather obstinate evil presence that was clearly the work of a person officially identified as one Ushu the witch by the authorities was dispelled. The suspect was traced to the mountains where she sucessfully hid from the agents of the witchhunting department. She is presently said to produce low-quality love potions in an unknown hideout somewhere in the western jungles."}}

Other rituals that are more complex still are bound to specific days, and to specific times as well. In fact, some individual spells can only be performed once a year or once every other year, while the most powerful of rituals may only be carried out during stellar constellations that are so incredibly rare that centuries may pass before the ritual can be performed again. Given the power and knowledge of the ancients it seems reasonable to assume that they have prepared rituals whose time has not even come to this very day. Since most of the ancient races have disappeared from the lands it is well possible that some of the rituals are still be buried in some long forgotten ruin, while others might actually be in the possession of some surviving heir of one of the ancient races.\nWho knows. The astrological knowledge of the ancients is yet to be rediscovered.

How haughtily he walked around in our beautiful Ankrahmun, mocking our true religion with his silly questions. Of course, he got nowhere and he seemed to give up in the end. But did the wisdom offered to him enlighten his blind soul? I think not. So full of himself was he, so firm in his heretic opinions and yet such a slave to his flesh - how could he understand that which is true and holy? People like him are both a curse and a blessing to us, the children of enlightenment.
