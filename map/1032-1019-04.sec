This legendary beast is much larger than any other specimen of its race, surpassing lions and even elephants in size, and it can tear a man apart in seconds with its enormous, razor-sharp teeth. What's more, the hyena king is said to be truly immortal, for it has been sighted time and again by numerous travellers and merchants. Many a caravan is said to have fallen prey to this ferocious beast, and it is widely believed to have amassed untold treasures over the centuries.\nThe legend goes that this beast was once a common hyena that was born in the time when the djinn war was at its peak. Somehow it had managed to escape the cataclysmic firestorm unleashed by the Efreet during the battle of Ankrahmun, and when the slaughter had finally ended it fed from the bodies of the fallen djinns, consuming large amounts of magical energy in the process. Perhaps these magical energies were responsible for the fateful mutation that turned a common hyena into this frightful beast."}}

It has been insinuated that he acted purposefully to sow the seeds of disunity among the djinn race, but considering his personal integrity this seems unlikely. Whatever his motives, though, Daraman's teachings caused a bitter controversy among the djinns, and eventually a fierce civil war broke out. This did a lot to ease the situation for the humans, but Banor was clear-sighted enough to know that his race would sooner or later get involved into the conflict. It was not hard to work out for him which side to support. Under the influence of Daraman's teachings Gabel, his former enemy, openly propagated peaceful coexistence between humans and djinns. Banor accepted this offer in the name of all humans and formed an alliance with the Marid. It was only logical then that the Alliance fought side by side in the battle of Ankrahmun against the Efreet who had secretly allied with the Drefian necromancers. The victory of the Alliance was overwhelming, but it came with a heavy price. A cataclysmic firestorm unleashed by the Efreet set the whole Kha'labal ablaze, forever turning what used to be a paradise into a barren wasteland. Countless human lives were lost in the magic inferno, and the survivors found that their homes had been destroyed. Faced with a choice of slowly starving to death or leaving their native land forever, a large group of survivors followed Banor on his quest for a new home. Their exodus triggered a chain of events that eventually resulted in the cataclysmic wars of the unliving, but it was also the fateful moment when the humans' slow, but steady conquest of the whole of Tibia started. But that is a different story."}}

But they did not leave the humans without guidance. There was Daraman, the gods' chosen prophet, who carefully prepared them for the spiritual and ethical challenges that awaited them in a world full of treachery and evil. And there was Banor, the very first human, a champion of superhuman might and life span, who taught his people how to fight on the battlefield. On his advice the pharaoh of Ankrahmun built a strong army, and it was Banor who designed the plans for Ankrahmun's famous fortifications. And soon enough the new human armies proved themselves in fierce battles against their undead and orcish enemies. Their kind paid heavy prices in these costly battles, but they learnt to accept sacrifices, and it soon become apparent that the human race was here to stay. Eventually only the fearsome djinns posed a real threat to the human race. They defeated the humans in several important battles using their fearsome magic and their skill with the scimitar. However, just when the situation appeared to be most dire Daraman, the revered human prophet, entered the scene and helped to neutralise the djinn threat in a way nobody had foreseen."}}

The shadows which in those days held the rest of the world in their cold grip became aware of the humans and of their riches, and soon enough they began to plot the young race's destruction. Ferocious orcs built fleets and started raiding the south-western coastline, while the north was threatened by eerie undead who began to spread their insidious poison among the terrified humans. Worse, the corruption slowly found its way into many of the humans's hearts, and strife and armed conflict erupted within the community. Some humans even fell for the morbid attraction of undeath. They formed an evil cult of necromancers and went to the north to found a city of their own. This city was called Drefia, and it soon became a source of the foulest corruption.\nThe humans, who were not used to such challenges, were full of sadness and despair, and many cursed the gods who apparently watched their plight in apathy. Little did they understand that all this was part of the gods' plan. It would take the humans a long time to understand that the very purpose of their race was to fight evil, and that their fate was not eternal bliss but endless struggle."}}

Protected on all sides by the sea or by insurpassable mountains, the Kha'labal was the perfect environment for the young, vulnerable race to flourish. And flourish and thrive it did. Guided by their leader Banor and endowed with amazing technical skills and knowledge by their creators, the humans managed to settle the whole Kha'labal within few generations, and beautiful buildings rose to the sky, the mightiest of which were to be found in the majestic city of Ankrahmun. These early humans, who today are called the Founders, were a friendly race who lived in peace and harmony with each other, ignorant of the horrors lurking in the outside world. And the gods, who watched them from their thrones in the Kha'zeel, smiled on them. "}}

But things were not quite the way they seemed. Theripat, who was a headstrong and idealistic girl, had always despised life at the court, and with the help of her nurse she had made many forays into the city, concealing her true identity. On one of these excursions she had fallen in love with a handsome officer from the pharaoh's guard. The young man requited the love of what he thought was a simple woman, and eventually the two lovers had even married. When the pharaoh finally decided it was time for his daughter to marry she was already 6 months pregnant, and she knew that soon the truth could no longer be hidden.

Theripat herself had escaped into the desert with her new-born child, but her unforgiving father sent half his army after her. She was found soon enough, but just when the troops were about to arrest her, the unexpected happened. Clinging her baby to her breast, the desperate mother fell into a piercing, bloodcurling wail that quickly expanded into an unearthly sound to which nature itself seemed to respond. All of a sudden a sandstorm erupted, fiercer and stronger than anybody could remember, and within minutes destruction rained down upon the pharaoh's terrified troops. When the storm cleared the soldiers were severely shaken, and many of the pharaoh's best chariots lay shattered in the sand. Theripat and her child, however, were gone forever, and nobody has seen them ever since. But each time the storm rages over the Kha'labal the superstitious people fall into a silent prayer to appease the wailing bride's fury."}}

Families were torn apart as children turned against their parents and brother fought brother. Worst of all, it soon turned out that both sides were roughly equal in strength, so that even though a number of vicious battles ensued it become more and more apparent that victory could not be won easily in this war. In fact, it appeared more and more likely that even if one of the sides could win it, it would so be crippled by the endeavour that the very existence of the djinn race would be threatened. Still the war raged on relentlessly. And the mutual hatred between the two fractions, who began to call themselves by the distinct names of Marid and Efreet, increased with every battle that was fought."}}

They put him in heavy chains and brought him before Gabel's throne. There the old man stood, all haggard and torn, amidst the splendour of the djnns' court. And the djinns started teasing and tormenting the human with a thousand malicious tricks, trying to strike terror in his heart. But frail and crippled though he was, Daraman never so much as flinched under the pain, and his will could not be broken. Finally Malor, who was the most vicious and godless of the djinn, lost his patience and raised his hand to strike the final blow. But lo!, just when his deadly scimitar was about to strike the prisoner down Gabel's voice thundered through the hall, ordering Malor to stop. And though mighty Malor trembled with anger and spite, he did not dare challenge his king's authority.", 2816 String="The Chronicles of Daraman II\n\nGabel was curious about the strange human who did not seem to know pain or fear. He approached him and asked him if he did not feel any pain. Daraman answered that the pain of the body was nothing compared to the pain of the soul.  So Gabel asked Daraman if he was not afraid. And the prophet said the famous words: \"The fear of death is but a trifle compared to the fear of life.\" So Gabel, who was more and more intrigued by the human, asked him whether he did not care at all about his life? Daraman just looked into the mighty djinn king's eyes, and a brief smile shone on his lips. And after a long pause he spoke thus: \"I am an old man and I have but little to lose, mylord. But your race has much to gain, for it lives in darkness.\" When he said those words many djinns were outraged by the human's apparent lack of respect. And if Gabel had not stopped them the prophet would have been killed on spot. "}}

Gabel immediately contacted the Efreet to let them know their leader was his prisoner, but his hopes that the rebellion would collapse without Malor were disappointed. The Efreet hated their Marid cousins too much to yield, and so the war continued. Nonetheless, both sides tried to avoid open conflicts, so there was next to no combat action for a long, long time. In fact, both the Marid and the Efreet planned to wait until their ranks would be replenished. But the losses they had suffered were great, and the djinns are not a fertile race. Century upon century passed and still their numbers had increased little. And while elsewhere the human race rose to power, building beautiful cities and establishing powerful empires, the djnn lived quiet in their remote fortresses. Malor, however, remained imprisoned in Fa'hradin's lamp, oblivious to the strange land his guardians had taken him.", 2831 String="The Djinn Wars VII - Malor's Liberation\n\nGabel had decided to hide Fa'hradin's lamp and its powerful prisoner in a forlorn place far to the north because he thought it would be safer there than in Ashta'daramai, his own fortress. Little did he know that these were very the lands where many centuries later a race of goblinoid barbarians called the orcs chose to erect a mighty fortress. One fateful day the lamp was found and brought to the orc king. It did not take the king's shamans long to work out that a mighty spirit was caught in the lamp, and soon enough the reckless king released the mighty djinn that had lain dormant for so many centuries. Little is known about what happened next, but even though to this day the orcs claim their king is still alive there are no credible witnesses who confirm that they have seen the orc king ever since. Malor, however, freely roams the world again, and many scholars agree that he will try every trick in the book to rekindle the fire of the djinn war."}}

The Marid would never forgive them their treachery, and this would be a battle the necromancers could not win - after all, many of them had already perished in the battle of Ankrahmun, and their Efreet allies could provide no assistance. So the necromancers prepared for the inevitable with the defiant cynicism of those who have been familiar with death all their lives, performing evil rituals and indulging in morbid orgies.\nFinally, the end came swifter than they expected. Unwilling to take any risks in the unpredictable halls and passageways of Drefia's dungeons, the Marid performed a fearsome ritual. The tortured earth underneath Drefia started moving like a giant whirlpool, and slowly the unholy city was pulled inside the maelstrom. Within half an hour it was gone completely, and all but the highest buildings were completely covered by sand and by rubble. None of its inhabitants have ever been seen again, but rumour has it that deep beneath the surface the unholy city is still intact, brooding like a vengeful animal in its prison.", 2831 String="The Djinn Wars V - Fa'hradin's Trick\n\nEven though many djinns had lost their lives during the fateful battle of Ankrahmun, the war was still undecided. Malor had lost many of his bravest warriors, but so had Gabel, and they both knew that another epic battle like that would bring the whole djinn race to the brink of destruction. In his desperation, Gabel turned to his trusted friend Fa'Hradin for advice. The old djinn suggested using a trick to eliminate Malor. Without their leader, he reasoned, the Efreet would end the rebellion. Gabel, who wanted to avoid further bloodshed, agreed. And so it came to pass that the magic lamp was created and, by means that are unknown to this very day, secretly placed in Malor's private chamber. The mighty Efreet never had a chance. When he went to sleep in what he thought was his private lamp he was trapped inside the lamp, which was soon enough smuggled out of Mal'Ouquah, the Efreets' fortress, and brought back to the Marid. Fa'hradin's trick had worked - Malor was Gabel's prisoner."}}

Here was something that he, who had seen so many things, could simply not understand, and he was determined to find out more about it. In the beginning he was still convinced that the prophet, like all other humans, was driven by a secret weakness, and he tried to use many other temptations to test the prophet. He clad the old man in silk and offered him a thousand gifts. But Daraman was as unimpressed by the djinns' fabulous wealth as he had been unimpressed by their tortures, and he politely rejected all gifts. And when Gabel finally asked him if he did not appreciate his gifts Daraman answered \"Mylord, I am an old man who has little use for pretty baubles. And truly I have never valued a thing that could be bought for gold.\" It was then that Gabel realised that Daraman was indeed a holy man.", 2816 String="The Chronicles of Daraman IV\n\nSo it came to pass that Daraman, who had come to the djinns' court, became the king's guest and confidant. And even though many djinns disdained their king's new favourite Gabel increasingly sought Daraman's company. Every day they went to the Gabel's personal garden and talked for many hours. It turned out that Gabel, the mighty djinn king who had been the terror of the world for such a long time, was plagued by a terrible feeling inner void, and Daraman's infinite spiritual strength became a source of joy and of redemption for him. And so, day by day and week by week, their relationship slowly changed from one between prisoner and a king to one between a master and his disciple."}}

When Daraman had seen deep into Gabel's soul he understood the pain and the confusion that lay hidden deep inside it, and he wept bitter tears of pity for Gabel and for the whole of his race, for he saw that the djinn were a forlorn race that had been cast away by its creator. So full of divine compassion were his tears that they froze into immaculate gemstones of pure blue crystal as soon as they left his eyes.
