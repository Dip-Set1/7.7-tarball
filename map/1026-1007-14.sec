They build mighty fortresses to seize control of all that walks the dreamlands, conscious \nor not. It was then, when the mysterious lord of dreams revealed himself and his anger shook the foundation of the dreamlands. Dreamers all over the world awakened screaming in fear and pain. And after the void came to rest and the first dreamwalkers returnd to the dreamlands the fortresses were gone! All of them with all of the ancients who manned them. The Shaig'laar lost their best men in theese days and never recovered from the loss. Such weakened they became an easy prey for the other ancients and so the time of the first dreammasters ended. \nFrom this time on all dreamwalkers only manipulate little of the matter of the dreamlands to fit their needs and never use their power to endanger others in their dreams. Dreams are ment to be a means of selffinding and prophecy, but not to be a weapon. ", 2821 String="As they killed the youngster i didn't help him, since I didn't know him. \nAs they killed the young knight i didn't help him since I had not much in common with that guy. \nAs they killed the local hero I didn't help him since  it was his own buiseness, not mine. \nAs they killed the monk who just lived to help others I didn't help him because he should have been more cautious. \nAs they killed my friend I didn't help since I thought I could not risk to fight them. \nAs they killed my brother I didn't help since I hoped they would at least spare me, for not interfering with their business. \nAs they killed me, there was no one left alive who could help me. ", 2821 String="Evil often seems invincibel, but even the longest journey beginns with a first little step. It is upon us to say 'NO' to evil. To deny them the space they need to blossom. We might fear them, but they can't scare us. We might be weaker, but they are the loosers at last. Evil is hollow and selfconsuming. Nothing can cancel the cold in their hearts, nothing can fill the lonlyness of an evil beeing. A life so centred on itself can't allow others to share it. Without sharing your life you deny it. Life is sharing. No one can stand life alone. To give birth you have to share and so you have to share to feel life. The evil one does not feel life, that is why he destroys it. He cant understand it and one fears what he can't understand.", 2816 String="Greed, selfishnes and hate are the soil that gives birth to evil. You can't neglect theese feelings since they are part of you. But you can understand them. To understand why you hate someone will give you a deeper understanding how to cease to hate. You may have to kill someone, but never do so only because you hate someone, but because you have to kill him to prevent a greater evil. \nYou also have to understand your positve feelings. \nThey are your shield to protect you from the assaults of negative emotions, they are the blanket that gives you warmth in desperate times. As long as you follow the path that these positive emotions show you, there is nothing that can harm YOU. They can hurt your body but your immortal soul is beyond their grasp..", 2816 String="Its important for a dreamwalker not to get lost in his dreams. To accomplish that you have to train your senses. You must become aware that you are dreaming, but not become awake. To train this, get accustomed to asking yourself : 'am I awake?' \nDo this at daytime as often as you think about it, But be carefull not to come to quick to the conclusion that you are awake. Try to 'fly' just on your thougt, try to change the world around you by sheer imgination. Take some time to test reality. \nAt some point of that training you will use this routine in your sleep as well. Then its essential to come to the conclusion that you are asleep! If you acomplished that you will have a hard time to balance between dreaming and awakening. At first you will often slip back in the dreamstate, but that will change at some point. Then you can beginn the art of dreamwalking.", 2816 String="Nightmares are not your enemy. Make them your best teachers. Learn about them. Understand them. If it is a repeated nightmare, think about it while awake. Think about a good ending for that dream, think this end again and again, feel comfortable with this happy end. Enjoy it. Have fun with it. So the nightmare looses its sting. You can even train yourself to dream the positve ending. \nSometimes its helpfull to wirte your dreams down. Don't try to analyze them. You will get used to understand them just by reading and reliving them. It's not necessary or can be even harmfull to force something. Take them as a nice story someone told to you. Enjoy them and think about how they could continue, or what would have happend if something like this happens in real life. Your dreams are your friends. All of them!"}}

We ensured that only a hero of courage and an unstained soul can find it. \nThe unholy place will be guarded by our order, if its necessary we wil guard it to eternity. \nNo magic will be able to discover the secrets now. \nWe used powerfull enchantments and all tricks our brightest minds came up with.

What a cowardish race. Without their aid many of our best men will die. I don't understand these sages, that asked me to understand the evlen point of view, I just understand the mothers and fathers that will ask me where their children are, after the battle that awaits us. Its almost certain that our messenger that was sent to the dwarfs and the king is dead. There will be no reinforcements and we will have to fight on our own.
