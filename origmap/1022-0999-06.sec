Therefore, those plants can been found near or sometimes even on the inside of dead trees.\n\nGoat Grass (flos capre)\nA low, nearly always four-leaved plant with yellow blossoms that grows in warm climate. It used to be the main source of food for the goats of the continent. However, later it was discovered to have a previously totally unknown poisenous long-term effect on the animals, and all goats died within two months."}}
