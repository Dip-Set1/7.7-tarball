Nevertheless it might be rather dangerous, \none may even die during his journeys through the lands!\nI wrote the following books in order to show the fates of 5 men who devoted themselves \nto discover new parts of Tibia. Each of them was a brave warrior and a superior explorer \nand they all went through exciting adventures. Their journeys were of different duration - \none ended after 66 days, another after 100 days. Each journey ended in a very dangerous \nsituation; one situation even ended deadly!"}}

Five days in this city and under these people, and I'm still not able to communicate with them.\nBut I do not resign - on the contrary, I get more and more interested in the language. I found out some more words, for example how they count: \"umog\" seems to be \"one\", and for each number more, they just put a \"tu-\" in front of \"umog\".\nThus, five would be called \"tutututumog\". It doesn't seem to me as if they would have highly developed mathematics, but the way to count seems sufficient for them. I wonder, how they were able to build this town...?\nMaybe an answer is, that they do not speak about numbers, but have short signs for writing them down.\nIt was surprising for me to find out they have a word for \"zero\", namely \"mog\". I hope to find out more in the next days.\nStrangely, they use words for numbers in each context they use numbers. So, \"umog\" stands for one, but also for \"once\", \"one time\", \"first\", ..."}}

For example, you might cross a river or perhaps it\nmight rain one day or the other. And maybe you can even find drinks on your way, but be careful!\nYou never know what is inside the potion you find.\nLet me again give you an example to illustrate this:\nOne of our five men travelling through Tibia (his name was longer than the name of the adventurer,\nwho was attacked by a troll and therefore had to stop his exploration) one day found a filled\npotion on his way. He was very thursty, and so he drank the liquid inside. He didn't know (how should he?) that it was poisoned. After some moments he noticed, that he felt worse and worse. At this moment, he had to stop and return to his house.\nBy the way, the name of this man (the poisoned one) was shorter than the name of the man,\nwhose journey was over after 83 days."}}
